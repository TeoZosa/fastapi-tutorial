# NOTE!
# Technical Details
# About `example` vs `examples`...
# JSON Schema defines a field `examples` in the most recent versions, 
# but OpenAPI is based on an older version of JSON Schema that didn't have examples.
# 
# So, OpenAPI defined its own `example` for the same purpose 
# (as `example`, not `examples`), and that's what is used by the docs UI (using Swagger UI).
# So, although example is not part of JSON Schema, 
# it is part of OpenAPI, and that's what will be used by the docs UI.

# Other info
# The same way, you could add your own custom extra info 
# that would be added to the JSON Schema for each model, 
# for example to customize a frontend user interface, etc.

"""Header Parameters"""
## Automatic conversion
from typing import Optional

from fastapi import FastAPI, Header

app = FastAPI()

#tl;dr: `-` converted to `_` automatically. 

# Header has a little extra functionality on top of what Path, Query and Cookie provide.
# 
# Most of the standard headers are separated by a "hyphen" character, 
# also known as the "minus symbol" (-).
# 
# But a variable like `user-agent` is invalid in Python.
# So, by default, 
# Header will convert the parameter names characters 
# from underscore (_) to hyphen (-) to extract and document the headers.
# 
# Also, HTTP headers are case-insensitive, so, 
# you can declare them with standard Python style (also known as "snake_case").
# 
# So, you can use `user_agent` as you normally would in Python code, 
# instead of needing to capitalize the first letters as `User_Agent` or something similar.
@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(user_agent: Optional[str] = Header(None)):
    return {"User-Agent": user_agent}

## Disable automatic conversion
from typing import Optional

from fastapi import FastAPI, Header

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/items/")

        # If for some reason you need 
        # to disable automatic conversion of underscores to hyphens, 
        # set the parameter `convert_underscores` of Header to False:
        strange_header: Optional[str] = Header(None, convert_underscores=False)
        ):
    return {"strange_header": strange_header}
# WARNING:
# Before setting convert_underscores to False, bear in mind that 
# some HTTP proxies and servers disallow the usage of headers with underscores.

## Duplicate headers
from typing import List, Optional

from fastapi import FastAPI, Header

app = FastAPI()

# It is possible to receive duplicate headers. That means, 
# the same header with multiple values.
# 
# You can define those cases using a 
# list in the type declaration.
# 
# You will receive all the values 
# from the duplicate header as a Python list.
# 
# For example, 
# to declare a header of X-Token 
# that can appear more than once, 
# you can write:
@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(x_token: Optional[List[str]] = Header(None)):
    return {"X-Token values": x_token}
# If you communicate with that path operation sending two HTTP headers like:
# X-Token: foo
# X-Token: bar
# 
# The response would be like:
# {
#     "X-Token values": [
#         "bar",
#         "foo"

# Technical Details
    # Data from forms is normally encoded using the "media type" 
    # `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
    # But when the form includes files, 
    # it is encoded as multipart/form-data. 

    # You'll read about handling files in the next chapter.
    # If you want to read more about these encodings and form fields, head to 
    # the MDN web docs for POST.

# Warning
    # can declare multiple Form parameters in a path operation, but you
    # can't also declare Body fields that you expect to receive as JSON, 
    # as the request will have the body encoded using
    # `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

# UploadFile has the following async methods. They all call the corresponding file methods underneath (using the internal SpooledTemporaryFile).
    # `write(data)`: Writes data (str or bytes) to the file.
    # `read(size)`: Reads size (int) bytes/characters of the file.
    # `seek(offset)`: Goes to the byte position offset (int) in the file.
    #       E.g., `await myfile.seek(0)` would go to the start of the file.
    #       This is especially useful if you run await `myfile.read()` once 
    #       and then need to read the contents again.
    # `close()`: Closes the file.

# As all these methods are async methods, you need to "await" them.
# For example, 
    # inside of an async path operation function 
    # you can get the contents with:
        # `contents = await myfile.read()`

# async Technical Details

    # and awaits for them.

# Starlette Technical Details
    # FastAPI's UploadFile inherits directly from Starlette's UploadFile,

# FastAPI's HTTPException vs Starlette's HTTPException
    # FastAPI has its own HTTPException.
        # And FastAPI's HTTPException error class inherits from Starlette's 
        # HTTPException error class.
    # The only difference, is that 
        # FastAPI's HTTPException allows you to 
        # add headers to be included in the response.
    # This is needed/used internally for OAuth 2.0 and some security utilities.
    
    # So, you can keep raising FastAPI's HTTPException as normally in your code.
        # But when you register an exception handler, you should register it for 
        #   Starlette's HTTPException.
        # This way, if any part of Starlette's internal code, or a Starlette 
        #   extension or plug-in, raises a Starlette HTTPException, 
        #   your handler will be able to catch and handle it.

## Re-use FastAPI's exception handlers
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fastapi.exception_handlers import (
    http_exception_handler,
    request_validation_exception_handler,
    )

# Starlette's exceptions is renamed to `StarletteHTTPException`:
from starlette.exceptions import HTTPException as StarletteHTTPException

# You could also just want to use the exception somehow, 
# but then use the same default exception handlers from FastAPI.

    # If you want to receive partial updates, 
    # it's very useful to use the parameter 
    # `exclude_unset` in Pydantic's model's `.dict()`
    # That would generate a dict with 
        # only the data that was set when creating the item model, excluding default values.
    # Then you can use this to generate a dict 
    # with only the data that was set (sent in the request), 
    # omitting default values

# Notice that the input model is still validated.

# So, if you want to receive partial updates that can omit all the attributes, 
# you need to have a model with all the attributes marked as optional 
# (with default values or None).

# To distinguish from the models with all optional values for updates 
# and models with required values for creation, 
# you can use the ideas described in "Extra Models".
